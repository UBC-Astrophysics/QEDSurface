The X-ray intensity (lower panel) and the linear polarization degree &Pi;<sub>L</sub> (upper panel) calculated with Nagel's (1981) model for &tau;<sub>Th</sub>=80 and W=0 as functions of the angle between the magnetic field and the view direction.  Figure 4a shows the result for the cylinder column parallel to the magnitude with E<sub>e</sub>=100 keV, whereas figure 4b shows the result for the slab of its surface perpendicular to the magneitc field with E<sub>e</sub>=50 keV.  The dashed and dot-dashed lines in the intensities represnet the contributions of the ordinary and extraordinary modes, respectively.  The linear polarization degree is Q/I.
