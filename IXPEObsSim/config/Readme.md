## Setting up the ixpe_file_model module


1.   You can find the [ixpe_file_model.py](https://github.com/UBC-Astrophysics/QEDSurface/blob/master/IXPEObsSim/config/ixpe_file_model.py) file in the [config](https://github.com/UBC-Astrophysics/QEDSurface/tree/master/IXPEObsSim/config) directory in the [QEDSurface](https://github.com/UBC-Astrophysics/QEDSurface) repository.
2.   You should make a copy the ixpe_file_model module to create a configuration file for your particular source.  
3. All of the key parameters are defined located at the top of the module.
4. At a minimum, you must define the following parametrers:
* Position of the source: `ra`, `dec`.
* Spin frequency, frequency first and second derivative: `nu0`, `nudot`, `nuddot`.
* File with spectral and polarization data: filename.
* Magnetic dipole geometry: `alpha` and `beta.
5. There are a few optional parameters:
* You can renormalize the phase-averaged flux before absorption to have a fixed value or to follow a given spectrum with the `normflux` parameter.  `normflux` can be a floating point number, an array of values corresponding to the energies listed in `filename`, a function or filename.
* You can apply interstellar absorption with the `NH` parameter.  `NH` can be a floating point number for the hydrogen column density or a string with a floating point number and filename: e.g. `"1e22;tbabs.dat"`. 
* You can also normalize the phase-average flux after absorption with the finalnorm parameter.
* As final step, the module assumes that your spectrum is in the units of counts/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/keV.  If it is in erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/keV, set `intensity_energy_units=True`, and it will perform the needed conversion.
6. The various files should be in the [config/ascii](https://github.com/UBC-Astrophysics/QEDSurface/tree/master/IXPEObsSim/config/ascii) directory.
7. The file that contains the spectral and polarization information (`filename`) must contain the following information with a header row at the top.
* Angle between the line of sight and the magnetic axis in radians: `Phi[rad]`
* Energy of radiation: `Energy[keV]`
* Intensity or flux: `I`
* Polarization with respect to the magnetic axis projected into the sky: `Q/I`

This file can contain other information, and the row and columns can be in any order.  The values of the angle and the energy must form a rectangular grid.
8. The file that contains the spectral renormalization information (`normflux`) must contain the following information with a header row at the top.
* Energy of radiation: `Energy[keV]`
* Flux: `I`
9. The file that contains the absoprtion cross section as a function of energy as defined in `NH` must contain the following information with a header row at the top.
* Energy of radiation in keV: `Energy`
* Cross section times <i>E</i><sup>3</sup> in units of 10<sup>-24</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> keV<sup>3</sup>: `sigma`.


## Components within the ixpe_file_model module

You can access all of the a forementioned parameters from outside the module as `ixpe_file_model.ra` for example.  There are many additional components defined with energy `E` in keV, inclination `i` in radians, phase `t` from 0 to 1:

* `energy_spectrum_inclination(E,i)`
* `ratio_inclination(E,i)`
* ` pol_deg(E, t, ra=None, dec=None)`
* `pol_ang(E, t, ra=None, dec=None)` in radians
* `rawspec(E,t)`: unabsorbed spectrum before renormalization
* `spec(E,t)`: absorbed counts spectrum after renormalization
