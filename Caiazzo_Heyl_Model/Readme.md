# Model Files

The four model files above correspond to the short (1 km) and long-column (7 km) and the one and two-column models presented in the following two papers.  The first column of each file contains the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic axis.  The value of Q is defined such that polarization along the direction of the magnetic field projected into the plane of the sky is positive.   Polarization in the perpendicular direction is negative.  The values of U and V vanish due to vacuum birefringence.  The parameters for the underlying B&W model are to fit the phase-averaged spectrum of Her X-1.  To use the intensity information in these files, first for the selected geometry calculate the phase-averaged spectrum as a function of energy from the files and renormalize all of the intensities to fit the observed phase-averaged spectrum.

## ABSTRACT

A new window is opening in high-energy astronomy: X-ray polarimetry. With many missions currently under development and scheduled to launch as early as 2021, observations of the X- ray polarisation of accreting X-ray pulsars will soon be available. As polarisation is particularly sensitive to the geometry of the emission region, the upcoming polarimeters will shed new light on the emission mechanism of these objects, provided that we have sound theoretical models that agree with current spectroscopic and timing observation and that can make predictions of the polarisation parameters of the emission. We here present a new model for the polarised emission of accreting X-ray pulsars in the accretion column scenario that for the first time takes into account the macroscopic structure and dynamics of the accretion region and the propagation of the radiation toward the observer, including relativistic beaming, gravitational lensing and quantum electrodynamics. In this paper we present all the details of the model, while in a companion paper, we apply our model to predict the polarisation parameters of the bright X-ray pulsar Hercules X-1.

## ABSTRACT

We employ our new model of the polarised emission of accreting X-ray pulsars to describe the emission from the luminous X-ray pulsar Hercules X-1. In contrast with previous works, our model predicts the polarisation parameters independently of spectral formation, and considers the structure and dynamics of the accretion column, as well as the additional effects on propagation due to general relativity and quantum electrodynamics. We find that our model can describe the observed pulse fraction and the pulse shape of the main peak, as well as the modulation of the cyclotron line with phase. We make predictions of how the polarisation signal appears as a function of phase and energy for different geometries
