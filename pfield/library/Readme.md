This library of pfield output is indexed by the radius and mass of the neutron star in centimetres, followed by the base-10 logarithm of the square of the magnetic moment (&mu;<sup>2</sup>) and the frequency (&nu;) in G cm<sup>3</sup> and Hz respectively.  The final term is the angle of the line of sight from the magnetic moment in degrees.

The effect of QED birefringence is characterised by &mu;<sup>2</sup> &nu; because the strength of the birefringence is proportional to B<sup>2</sup> in the weak-field limit, and its effects are proportional to frequency.
